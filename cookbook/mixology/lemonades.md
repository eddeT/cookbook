Collecting different recipes for lemonades. 

## Limeade with Orange hint

Just something I tried on a whim; it was ok. Might make again.

### Lime and orange oleo saccharum
* 4x lime (peels only)
* 1/4 orange (peel only)
* 1/2 dL sugar

Put in a sealed container and let sit for at least an hour. More time is better.\
Stir a few times when you walk past it.

### Syrup
Rich Syrup (2:1) ratio
* 1 dL sugar
* 1/2 dL water

Heat mixture in a pot until sugar dissolves, let cool.

### Juice the fruits
* 4x lime
* 1/2 orange

### Mix it
Fetch a decently sized pitcher.

* Rinse oleo saccharum out of the container into the pitcher.
* Add the syrup
* Add the juice
* Add 8 dLs of water (less or more depending on how sweet you like it)
* Stir

Done!
